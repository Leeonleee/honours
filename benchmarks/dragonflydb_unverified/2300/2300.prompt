Bug UB on access invalid prime table iterator
This bug can happen is a very rare case when source and dest key of command belong to the same bucket of dash table.
On commands that have a source and dest key ,we call dash table Find for both source and dest key. On Find we do bumpup therefore we can invalidate the iterator to the one we called Find first if both source and dest keys are on the same bucket.

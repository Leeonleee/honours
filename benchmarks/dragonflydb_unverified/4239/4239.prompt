Unpatched Redis Sources (CVE-2022-33105)
The master branch of the dragonfly project contains unpatched sources from redis, in which CVE-2022-33105 was reported with high severity. The function `streamGetEdgeID` from `dragonfly/src/redis/t_stream.c` does not include patches and updates available in newer versions of redis, which can cause a memory leak. The fix for CVE can be found in this commit: [redis commit](https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/4a7a4e42db8ff757cdf3f4a824f66426036034ef).

To ensure that all patches are applied, I recommend updating the redis files in the dragonfly project to the latest version.

My report was primarily based on a static analysis tool developed at [CAST](https://castech.am/), which flagged the potential vulnerability due to similarities in the codebase.

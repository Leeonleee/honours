Support Stream data structure
Hello, came across Dragonfly on Hacker News. Very cool project â€“ good luck with it!

I am very interested in [Stream data structure](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/) support - think that's the only missing command for me to start experimenting with Dragonfly.

Specifically, in my use case I am using:

* XADD
* XRANGE
* XREVRANGE

Hope this will be added at some point.

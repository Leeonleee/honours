_shard_num bug fix 
Create a table based on engine PostgreSQL like this 

```
'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS xxx
(
xxxx
) ENGINE = PostgreSQL(own_pg, table='xxx');'
```
When I exec this sql , it will be transfered like below:
Clickhouse : 
```
SELECT * FROM proxy.sys_nic WHERE  mode !=100 and type=0 and name!='' and _shard_num in (1) ORDER BY _shard_num,name LIMIT 20;
```
Postgres receive:
 ```
SELECT "id", "type", "mode", "state", "name", "nick_name", "description", "speed", "mac", "pci_no", "exist", "create_by", "create_time", "update_by", "update_time" 
 FROM "sys_nic" WHERE ("mode" != 100) AND ("type" = 0) AND 1
```
So, Postgres will report a error :  The argument to AND must be of type boolean, not of type integer,because of  PG can't recognize **and 1**
error when select from postgresql() where 1=1 and (id=id)
CH 22.8.12.45

When trying to query postgresql function with condition WHERE 1=1 and (id=id) (generated query) ch generates query with wrong syntax for postgres.

Any query to postgres:
```sql
select * from postgresql(...)
where 1=1 and id=id 

```

Code: 1001. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: pqxx::sql_error: ERROR:  argument of AND must be type boolean, not type integer
LINE 1: ...column" FROM "table" WHERE 1 AND ("id...

It's same issue as #33152 but when condition (which ch can not optimize) added provided fix is not working
clickhouse adapts to postgresql
When I use the ch table and the table imported by the PostgreSql table (pg_algo_input_customer) engine as views, I filter the fields in pg_algo_input_customer. Clickhouse embedded the condition in the pg_algo_input_customer table sql as where 1, but the syntax of where 1 is not supported in pgsql, how do I make this view sql valid using the pg table engine?

The sql statementï¼š
       select date, customer, level
       from pg_algo_input_customer
       where level != 'ZZ'.

The view contains the 'level' above, And when i used 'level' column, ch embeds 'and 1' into sql: WHERE ("level" != 'ZZ') AND 1), then throw this error 'std::exception. Code: 1001, type: pqxx::sql_error, e.what() = ERROR: argument of AND must be type boolean, not type integer'.

Ephemeral columns with Map type crash the server
**Describe what's wrong**

Creating a table with a Map-type Ephemeral column will make the server crash on the restart because of wrongly save metadata.

Fiddle to reproduce: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/81fc3a83-f7ea-43c2-afad-2e2940d04e8c

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Tested on version 22.11.1.1286.

**How to reproduce**

* Use version 22.11.x
* Use the fiddle above to reproduce.

**Expected behavior**

When creating a `EPHEMERAL` columns, a default value is assigned.
Example with a Int32:
```sql
CREATE TABLE name (
  example_col Int32 EPHEMERAL
) -- ... engine stuff here ...
```

Metadata will assign a default value:
```sql
CREATE TABLE name (
  example_col Int32 EPHEMERAL 0
) -- ... engine stuff here ...
```

But, with Map-type, no default value gets assigned, only a `()` (empty parenthesis).

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```

**Additional context**

The issue can't be fixed by setting a default expression after `EPHEMERAL`, this, for example will not work:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bug_ephemeral (
    id Int32,
    data Map(String, Int32) EPHEMERAL {},
    result Int DEFAULT data['number'] * 2
)
Engine = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (id);
```

But this, is accepted:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bug_ephemeral (
    id Int32,
    data Int32 EPHEMERAL 12,
    result Int DEFAULT data * 2
)
Engine = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (id);
```

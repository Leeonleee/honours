sql【1】:  
`select count()
from (
         SELECT event_dt
         FROM (select event_dt, 403 AS event_id
               from (
                        select event_dt
                        from tba as tba
                        where event_id = 9
                          and ((tba.event_dt >= 20220822 and tba.event_dt <= 20220822))
                        )) tba
         WHERE tba.event_dt >= 20220822
           and tba.event_dt <= 20220822
         );`

sql【2】:
`select count()
from (
         SELECT event_dt
         FROM (select event_dt, 403 AS event_id
               from (
                        select event_dt
                        from tba as tba
                        where event_id = 9
                          and ((tba.event_dt >= 20220822 and tba.event_dt <= 20220822))
                        )) tba
         WHERE tba.event_dt >= 20220822
           and tba.event_dt <= 20220822
           and event_id = 403
         );`

toStartOfMinute without WHERE omitted non-aligned times
I have struggled to recreate this issue on an isolated from-the-scratch example so will describe the in-situ scenario instead

A (Summing)MergeTree table is sorted by a timestamp (plus a bunch of other columns) and is full of data that I have a select query on with a `toStartOfMinute` to add-up totals of some count column over minute intervals. A bit like this (for illustration only):

```
CREATE TABLE x (t DateTime, n UInt32) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY t
INSERT INTO x VALUES ('2022-09-17 07:00:00', 1) ('2022-09-17 07:00:30', 2)
SELECT toStartOfMinute(t) AS s, sum(n) FROM x WHERE s = '2022-09-17 07:00:00' GROUP BY s
```

Expected result is 3. My real table returns the equivalent of 1, ie the 07:00:30 row is missing

The necessary conditions for this to happen include:

- use `toStartOfMinute` instead of `toStartOfInterval(toIntervalMinute(1))`, and
- don't try to filter down to specific rows using WHERE (instead I let query print full output and manually filter that)

Below are some differences of notice. Apart from size, the real table differs from the illustration one by a few other things like partitioning and replication. Of those only the size feels substantial; my illustration query does not break down into concurrent blocks like the real one.

### Good

ie `toStartOfInterval`

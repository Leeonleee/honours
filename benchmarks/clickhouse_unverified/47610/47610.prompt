clickhouse-format doesn't hilite some identifiers
Hey!

1. In this query the `identifier` is not hilited â€” is it intended behaviour? I think it should either be hilited as an identifier, or an alias.
```
$ ./clickhouse-format --hilite --query "with identifier as (select * from table) select * from table"
WITH identifier AS
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM table
    )
```

2. And also there's another identifier output without being hilited, but I cannot come up with the query which corresponds to this code - any help?

3. There seems to be an inconsistensy of manually applied hilite, as it's never removed within this if:

Make StorageSet::getSet() thread safe
Found by TSan.
Happened when CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE = Set()
and TRUNCATE TABLE is called

    DB::StorageSet::truncate
    DB::InterpreterDropQuery::executeToTableImpl
    ...
    DB::InterpreterDropQuery::execute

and mutations are happening

    DB::ExpressionAnalyzer::isPlainStorageSetInSubquery calls `return storage_set->getSet();`    
    DB::ExpressionAnalyzer::tryMakeSetForIndexFromSubquery 
    ...
    DB::MergeTreeDataMergerMutator::mutatePartToTemporaryPart DB::StorageMergeTree::mutateSelectedPart
    DB::StorageMergeTree::scheduleDataProcessingJob

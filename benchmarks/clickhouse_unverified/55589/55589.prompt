MySQL compatibility: Illegal type String of argument of function toDayOfWeek
Required for Tableau Online. 

Sample rendered query:

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(((((7 + DAYOFYEAR(cell_towers.updated)) - 1) +
               DAYOFWEEK(DATE_FORMAT(cell_towers.updated, '%Y-01-01 00:00:00'))) - 1) / 7) AS wk_updated_ok
FROM cell_towers
GROUP BY 1;
```

fails with

```
DB::Exception: Illegal type String of argument of function toDayOfWeek. Must be Date, Date32, DateTime or DateTime64.: In scope SELECT FLOOR(((((7 + DAYOFYEAR(cell_towers.updated)) - 1) + DAYOFWEEK(DATE_FORMAT(cell_towers.updated, '%Y-01-01 00:00:00'))) - 1) / 7) AS wk_updated_ok FROM cell_towers GROUP BY 1. (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)
```

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use: latest master
* Which interface to use, if matters: MySQL
* Sample data for all these tables: cell_towers sample dataset

**Expected behavior**

DAYOFWEEK accepts String argument like in MySQL.

Wrong result of SELECT statement with compile_expressions in recent commits (affected version: 21-23.5.1)
**Describe what's wrong**

The SELECT statement with contradictory WHERE conditions should return empty results. However, it outputs one row.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It can be reproduced in the latest version.

**How to reproduce**

Version: 23.5.1.1 (commit 3e6314675c6467bc4dd78f659bac862f7e9648f8)

Easy reproduce in ClickHouse fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/7b30dc3b-efea-4b23-937c-6fcb19893bbc

_Set up database_

```sql
create table t1 (c6 UInt32, c7 UInt32, primary key(c6)) engine = MergeTree;
insert into t1 values (76, 57);
```

_bug-triggering query_

```sql
select
    c_5_c1470_1 as c_2_c1479_2
  from
    (select
          stddevSamp(ref_10.c6) as c_5_c1470_1
        from
          t1 as ref_10) as subq_1
  where ((subq_1.c_5_c1470_1 = subq_1.c_5_c1470_1)
        and (not (subq_1.c_5_c1470_1 = subq_1.c_5_c1470_1)));
```

**Expected behavior**

The query must output empty because the conditions `(subq_1.c_5_c1470_1 = subq_1.c_5_c1470_1)` and `(not (subq_1.c_5_c1470_1 = subq_1.c_5_c1470_1))` are contradictory. 

**Actual behavior**

It outputs one row
```
+-------------+
| c_2_c1479_2 |
+-------------+
|         nan |
+-------------+
```

**Additional context**

1. At the first several times, the query output an empty result. But after several tries, the results become incorrect, similar as #50039
2. This bug still exists after the fix for https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50039
3. if `set compile_expressions = 0`, the bug disappears, so it should be also related to compile_expressions.
4. The earliest reproducible version is 21 in fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/617e1e6d-8e5c-41a7-acca-31c8bff38e04, which is different from #50269 (only head version).
5. Before version 21, the query outputs empty (e.g. 21.12.4.1-alpine: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/c16460b5-3011-4fa9-b641-c0266a227c14).




Wrong result of SELECT statement with compile_expressions in recent commits (head version)
**Describe what's wrong**

The two semantically-equivalent SELECT statements should output the same results, but they did not.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It cannot be reproduced in the latest version, but it can be reproduced in the head version.

**How to reproduce**

Version: 23.5.1.1 (commit 3e6314675c6467bc4dd78f659bac862f7e9648f8)

Easy reproduce in ClickHouse fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/184cce9d-1e87-4666-afc1-97d281cc11cd

_Set up database_

```sql
create table t1 (pkey UInt32, c4 UInt32, c5 Float32, primary key(pkey)) engine = MergeTree;
insert into t1 values (12000, 36, 77.94);
```

_SELECT statement 1_

```sql
select  
  subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 as c_1_c3371_2
from 
  (select  
        corr(ref_0.c4,ref_0.c4) over w0 as c_4_c3362_6 
      from 
        t1 as ref_0
      window w0 as (partition by ref_0.c5 order by ref_0.pkey asc)
  ) as subq_1
where not (not (subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 <> subq_1.c_4_c3362_6));
```

As `not (not (subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 <> subq_1.c_4_c3362_6))` can be replaced with `subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 <> subq_1.c_4_c3362_6`, I get the semantically-equivalent SELECT statement:

_SELECT statement 2_

```sql
select  
  subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 as c_1_c3371_2
from 
  (select  
        corr(ref_0.c4,ref_0.c4) over w0 as c_4_c3362_6 
      from 
        t1 as ref_0
      window w0 as (partition by ref_0.c5 order by ref_0.pkey asc)
  ) as subq_1
where subq_1.c_4_c3362_6 <> subq_1.c_4_c3362_6;
```

**Expected behavior**

The two SELECT statements output the same results.

**Actual behavior**

They are different.

SELECT statement 1 outputs:
```
+-------------+
| c_1_c3371_2 |
+-------------+
|         nan |
+-------------+
```

SELECT statement 2 outputs an empty result.

**Additional context**

1. This bug can be triggered only in the head version, so it should be involved by recent commits.
2. At the first several times, the SELECT statement 1 outputs an empty result. But after several tries, the results become incorrect, similar to #50039.
3. if `set compile_expressions = 0`, the bug disappears, so it should be also related to compile_expressions.

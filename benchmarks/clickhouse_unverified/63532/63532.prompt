<issue>
Index analysis does not work for comparison between `DateTime` and `DateTime64`.
This test does not pass:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;
CREATE TABLE test (d DateTime, PRIMARY KEY (d));
INSERT INTO test SELECT toDateTime('2024-01-01') + number FROM numbers(1e6);
SET max_rows_to_read = 10000;
SELECT count() FROM test WHERE d <= '2024-01-01 02:03:04';
SELECT count() FROM test WHERE d <= toDateTime('2024-01-01 02:03:04');
SELECT count() FROM test WHERE d <= toDateTime64('2024-01-01 02:03:04', 0);
SELECT count() FROM test WHERE d <= toDateTime64('2024-01-01 02:03:04', 3);
DROP TABLE test;
```

<issue>
Logical error: 'StorageJoin doesn't contain column '.
```
ATTACH TABLE join_any_left
(
    `s` String, 
    `x` Array(UInt8), 
    `k` UInt64
)
ENGINE = Join(ANY, LEFT, k);

SELECT joinGet('join_any_left', '', number) FROM numbers(3);
```

Probably should be a user error check somewhere above.

@4ertus2 FYI

 We also use simple fuzz test to generate random SQL queries and to check that the server does not die executing them.
 You can find it in `00746_sql_fuzzy.pl`. This test should be run continuously (overnight and longer).
 
-We also use sophisticated AST-based query fuzzer that is able to find huge amount of corner cases. It does random permutations and substitutions in queries AST. It remembers AST nodes from previous tests to use them for fuzzing of subsequent tests while processing them in random order. You can learn more about this fuzzer in [this blog article](https://clickhouse.com/blog/en/2021/fuzzing-clickhouse/).

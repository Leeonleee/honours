Logical error when trying to use bloom filter index on `Array(LowCardinality(String))`
**Describe what's wrong**

Get data from #29693.

```
ALTER TABLE hackernews
    ADD COLUMN words Array(LowCardinality(String))
    DEFAULT arraySort(
              arrayDistinct(
                extractAll(
                  lower(
                    decodeXMLComponent(
                      extractTextFromHTML(text))),
                  '\w+')));

ALTER TABLE hackernews MATERIALIZE COLUMN words;

ALTER TABLE hackernews ADD INDEX words_bf (words) TYPE bloom_filter(0.01) GRANULARITY 1;

ALTER TABLE hackernews MATERIALIZE INDEX words_bf;

SELECT * FROM system.merges \G;

...

SELECT count() FROM hackernews WHERE has(words, 'clickhouse');

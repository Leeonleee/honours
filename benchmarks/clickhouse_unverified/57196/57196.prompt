`Block structure mismatch in UnionStep stream: different number of columns` when projections are used with JOIN
How to reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (id UInt32, s String) Engine = MergeTree ORDER BY id;

CREATE TABLE t2 (id1 UInt32, id2 UInt32) Engine = MergeTree ORDER BY id1;
INSERT INTO t2 SELECT * from generateRandom() LIMIT 100;
ALTER TABLE t2 ADD PROJECTION proj (SELECT id2 ORDER BY id2);
INSERT INTO t2 SELECT * from generateRandom() LIMIT 100;

SELECT s FROM t1 as lhs LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERER id2 = 1) as rhs ON lhs.id = rhs.id2;

Received exception from server (version 23.11.1):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Block structure mismatch in UnionStep stream: different number of columns:
id2 UInt32 UInt32(size = 0)
id UInt32 UInt32(size = 0), s String String(size = 0). (LOGICAL_ERROR)
```

MySQL compatibility: concat should also accept 1 argument
Tableau's `STR(x)` function uses `concat` under the hood with just one argument to convert the input to a String (instead of `CONVERT` or just `CAST x AS type`).

A calculated field such as:
```
IF ISNULL([User Id]) THEN [Address] ELSE STR([User Id]) END
```

generates the following error:

```
Code: 42. DB::Exception: Number of arguments for function concat doesn't match: passed 1, should be at least 2.: While processing if(userId IS NULL, address, concat(userId)). (NUMBER_OF_ARGUMENTS_DOESNT_MATCH) (version 23.11.1.1442 (official build))
```
</issue>

I need you to solve the provided issue by generating a code fix that can be applied directly to the repository

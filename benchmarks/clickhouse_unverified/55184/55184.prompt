Remove the removal of broken detached parts
This is a harmful feature - it has to be removed.
If there are broken parts, it requires immediate attention of an engineer.
They should never be deleted.

I remember this feature was added by one customer because they asked too many times.
But the truth is - the introduction of this feature is harmful even for that customer.

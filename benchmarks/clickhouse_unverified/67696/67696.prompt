Different check names in the CI database and in the report
The CI checks database has names like `Stateless tests (tsan) [1/4]`: https://play.clickhouse.com/play?user=play#U0VMRUNUIGNoZWNrX3N0YXJ0X3RpbWUsIGNoZWNrX25hbWUsIHRlc3RfbmFtZSwgcmVwb3J0X3VybApGUk9NIGNoZWNrcwpXSEVSRSBjaGVja19zdGFydF90aW1lID49IG5vdygpIC0gSU5URVJWQUwgMjQgSE9VUgogICAgQU5EIHB1bGxfcmVxdWVzdF9udW1iZXIgPSAwCiAgICBBTkQgdGVzdF9zdGF0dXMgIT0gJ1NLSVBQRUQnCiAgICBBTkQgKHRlc3Rfc3RhdHVzIExJS0UgJ0YlJyBPUiB0ZXN0X3N0YXR1cyBMSUtFICdFJScpIAogICAgQU5EIGNoZWNrX3N0YXR1cyAhPSAnc3VjY2VzcycKT1JERVIgQlkgY2hlY2tfc3RhcnRfdGltZQ==

The CI logs database has names like `Stateless tests (tsan)`.

The HTML report names it as `ClickHouse Stateless Tests (tsan) [1/4]`: https://s3.amazonaws.com/clickhouse-test-reports/67653/c50ef37a03438003c21076c5700d9c1f52c1c435/stateless_tests__tsan__[1_4].html

I don't know why there is such a difference.

At least the CI logs database should have the suffix `[1/4]`.

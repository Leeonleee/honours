Received exception:
Code: 427. DB::Exception: OptimizedRegularExpression: cannot compile re2: ^��, error: invalid UTF-8. Look at https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax for reference. Please note that if you specify regex as an SQL string literal, the slashes have to be additionally escaped. For example, to match an opening brace, write '\(' -- the first slash is for SQL and the second one is for regex: While processing 'test' LIKE '��%'. (CANNOT_COMPILE_REGEXP)

Do not trigger the limit on number of rows to read if it's a trivial query with LIMIT.
```
milovidov-Pro-P30 :) SET max_rows_to_read = 1000000

SET max_rows_to_read = 1000000

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.007 sec. 

milovidov-Pro-P30 :) SELECT number FROM numbers(1000000000) LIMIT 1

SELECT number
FROM numbers(1000000000)
LIMIT 1

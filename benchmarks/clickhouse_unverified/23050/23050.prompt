FORMAT JSON omits a }
When formatting the output of query as JSON a closing curly brace is missing in the data section.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Reproducible in 21.1.2

**How to reproduce**
```
ClickHouse client version 21.1.2.15 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 21.1.2 revision 54443.
```

I used the Github dataset, created the table and importet data according to (https://github-sql.github.io/explorer/#download-the-dataset)

The query (from (https://github-sql.github.io/explorer/#how-has-the-list-of-top-repositories-changed-over-the-years), added `FORMAT JSON`)

```
SELECT
    repo AS name,
    groupArrayInsertAt(toUInt32(c), toUInt64(dateDiff('month', toDate('2015-01-01'), month))) AS data
FROM
(
    SELECT
        lower(repo_name) AS repo,
        toStartOfMonth(created_at) AS month,
        count() AS c
    FROM github_events
    WHERE (event_type = 'WatchEvent') AND (toYear(created_at) >= 2015) AND (repo IN
    (
        SELECT lower(repo_name) AS repo
        FROM github_events
        WHERE (event_type = 'WatchEvent') AND (toYear(created_at) >= 2015)
        GROUP BY repo
        ORDER BY count() DESC
        LIMIT 10
    ))
    GROUP BY
        repo,
        month
)
GROUP BY repo
ORDER BY repo ASC
FORMAT JSON
```
returns

```

Notice the missing `}` after the last name/data tuple of the returned rows

Sadly i was not able to reproduce with a simpler statement or built in tables.

**Expected behavior**
There should be a `}`

Problems with new mongoDB implementation
clickhouse v.24.10.2.80

use_legacy_mongodb_integration disabled

1) Different execution time of table function and table engine

```
--mongo collection with ±4000000 records
CREATE TABLE mongo_table
(
    `_id` String
)
ENGINE = MongoDB('host:port', 'schema', 'table', 'user', 'pass', 'authSource=admin&connectTimeoutMS=36000');

select *
from mongodb('host:port', 'schema', 'table', 'user', 'pass',
             structure='_id String', options='authSource=admin&connectTimeoutMS=36000')
where _id='my_id';

select * from mongo_table where _id='my_id';
```

```
elapsed time for select from table function: **1 row retrieved starting from 1 in 2 m 42 s 769 ms (execution: 2 m 42 s 570 ms, fetching: 199 ms)**
elapsed time for select from table engine: **1 row retrieved starting from 1 in 303 ms (execution: 83 ms, fetching: 220 ms)**
```

Looks that pushdown of where condition is not work for table function.

2) Also, i have some troubles with select from table function with limit.

For some cases 
```
select *
from mongodb('host:port', 'schema', 'table', 'user', 'pass',
             structure='_id String', options='authSource=admin&connectTimeoutMS=36000')
where _id='my_id'
limit 1; --different behaviour for query with and without limit clause
```
return 0 records with limit, and 1 record without limit(and its correct) 
Incorrect MongoDB UUID conversion to Clickhouse ?

### Question

I am working with MongoDB engine in my project.
In MongoDB in a collection I have an identifier of the form:
`_id: UUID('d0b3997a-0907-4d29-b685-a55beb9fe727')`

I deployed in clickhouse docker version 24.8 with a setting in the config 
`<use_legacy_mongodb_integration>true<use_legacy_mongodb_integration>` and everything worked fine.

The `_id: UUID('d0b3997a-0907-4d29-4d29-b685-a55beb9fe727')` was successfully converted to a UUID of the form 'd0b3997a-0907-4d29-4d29-b685-a55beb9fe727' in clickhouse.

I recently saw that in the `24.10` release they added the ability to get nested data from MongoDB, which also made me happy. The instructions said to set the `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` setting to false, which I did. 
After that I couldn't get `_id: UUID('d0b3997a-0907-4d29-b685-a55beb9fe727')` from MongoDB as UUID, I get an error

```
Code: 53. DB::Exception: Type mismatch, expected string (UUID), got binary for column _id: While executing MongoDB. (TYPE_MISMATCH)
```

If I get it as String, I get an unreadable value: `г�z	M)���[��'`

The same with version 24.11.
But as soon as I enable `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` = false - the conversion works correctly.


Could you please tell me what could be wrong, am I doing something wrong or is this a potential bug?

AST Fuzzer: `Assertion `key0->size() > i' failed`
https://s3.amazonaws.com/clickhouse-test-reports/0/6fefc900a60c4e10ca4eae098d6d11c0654e3f99/ast_fuzzer__debug_.html

This was likely introduced by https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68630

Repro:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cube__fuzz_42 (`a` Nullable(Float32), `b` UInt32, `s` Nullable(UInt32)) ENGINE = Memory;
INSERT INTO cube__fuzz_42 FORMAT Values(null, 2, null);
INSERT INTO cube__fuzz_42 FORMAT Values(3, 3, 3);
SELECT char(sipHash64Keyed((CAST(materialize('1'), 'UInt64'), CAST('2', 'UInt64')), map([0], materialize(1), [2], toLowCardinality(3))), 22) FROM cube__fuzz_42 GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((a), (b)) ORDER BY [sipHash128(materialize(44), tuple(1)) = sipHash128('2', toNullable(1), 1, 1, 1, toLowCardinality(5))] DESC;
```

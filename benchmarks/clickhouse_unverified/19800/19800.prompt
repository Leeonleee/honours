But it throw a exception : Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 1366, e.displayText() = mysqlxx::BadQuery: Incorrect string value: '\xF0\x9F\xA6\x84\xE2\x98...' for column 'person_name' at row 1 (*****:3306) (version 20.8.4.11)

The column value in clickhouse isÔºöÂ∞èÈáéÈ©¨-ü¶Ñ‚òÅÔ∏è ,while remote  mysql CHARSET is utf8mb4; It seems that the exception  because of the emoji value. How can I fix this problem?

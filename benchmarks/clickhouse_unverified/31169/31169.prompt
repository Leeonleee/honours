Not Like to Range in KeyCondition seems to be incorrect
@zhyass and I found some codes may be incorrect in

https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/33ffe11d0397aa6904c246172223b1da1fbcf1cc/src/Storages/MergeTree/KeyCondition.cpp#L280-L297

It tries to extract fixed prefix from the like pattern to find the range, but it's wrong, A counterexample is ï¼š

like_pattern  -> "a%c",  the prefix will be "a" and the range will be ` Range("a", true,"b", false)` yet the String "axxxxxd" still not match match this pattern (  axxxxxd not like a%c => true  ).

`Not like` is not the reverse of `Like` in continuous key ranges.

The only special case to work fine for "not like" to range is that string pattern ends with "%" or "_" , eg:    'a%', 'a\_'

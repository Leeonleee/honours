user_defined directory is getting created in my user home directory

I updated our clickhouse-server container a few weeks ago. I use clickhouse-client on a physical server through some scripts, and It started complaining about not having permission somewhere, but I wasn't able to determine where it was having a problem, as the message was pretty cryptic.  I ran clickhouse-client in the script as sudo, and it worked as expected.  I was now able to run this anytime afterward without using sudo.  The problem is now clickhouse-client (I think) is creating the directory, user_defined, in my home directory.  If I delete the directory, it is recreated the next time the scripts run.  Is this some sort of configuration issue?  I'm not sure if this is the result of updating the clickhouse-server container, or if clickhouse-client is the problem (which is on a physical server and updates regularly via apt upgrade).

This is now occurring in both our dev and production environments.

We are running on Ubuntu 20.04:
ClickHouse client version 24.1.2.5 (official build)
ClickHouse server version 23.9.2

The error that was being thrown (less the record) before running clickhouse-client as sudo:

Code: 83. DB::Exception: Couldn't create directory /user_defined/ reason: 'Permission denied': While executing ValuesBlockInputFormat: data for INSERT was parsed from query: (in query: insert into XXX values(XXX). (DIRECTORY_DOESNT_EXIST)

We aren't using any user_defined things, so I'm not quite sure how to fix this.
thanks,

Problem with Array(Tuple(LowCardinality(String), Int32))
I have a table

```
CREATE TABLE table (
	id Int32,
	values Array(Tuple(LowCardinality(String), Int32)),
	date Date
) ENGINE MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date)
ORDER BY (id, date)
```

but when executing the request

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM table
WHERE (arrayExists(x -> ((x.1) = toLowCardinality('pattern')), values) = 1)

```
I get an error

`Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from clickhouse:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot capture column 3 because it has incompatible type: got String, but LowCardinality(String) is expected..`

If I replace the column 'values' 
values Array(Tuple(String, Int32))
then the request is executed without errors.

What could be the problem when using Array(Tuple(LowCardinality(String), Int32))?

ClickHouse version 20.3.3

<issue>
Sequence missing from catalog with ATTACH
### What happens?

I'm not sure this is an issue or expected behavior, but I found the following suprising.

Attaching to database with `ATTACH` for a database with a sequence raises a Catalog Error (for a missing sequence).


### To Reproduce


**Create DB**

```sh
duckdb db.duckdb
```

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE 'id_seq';
CREATE TABLE person (id INT DEFAULT nextval('id_seq'), age INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO person (age) VALUES (10);
```

**Attach in a new session**

```sh
duckdb
```

```sql
ATTACH 'db.duckdb';
# Error: Catalog Error: Sequence with name id_seq does not exist!
```

Everything works fine connecting to existing db when starting cli:

```
duckdb db.duckdb
```

MODE() WITHIN GROUP Incorrect Output
### What happens?

MODE() WITHIN GROUP when provided with an ORDER BY value DESC doesn't produce the correct output.

### To Reproduce

```
SELECT MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_occurrences DESC) FROM (
VALUES
	(500, 1),
	(1000, 2),
	(800, 3),
	(1000, 4),
	(500, 5),
	(550, 6),
	(400, 7),
	(200, 8),
	(10, 9)
)items_per_order(order_occurrences, item_count);
```
Should output 1000, but gives 500.

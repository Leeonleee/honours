Wrong update count in JDBC when INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING statement does nothing
### What happens?

This may or may not be a bug (if it's not, then I suggest documenting this behaviour).

When running an `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` statement, which produces a conflict and thus does nothing, I would expect the resulting update count to be `0`, not `1`

### To Reproduce

```java
try (Statement s = connection.createStatement()) {
    try {
        s.executeUpdate("create table t (i int primary key, j int)");

        System.out.println(s.executeUpdate("insert into t values (1, 1) on conflict do nothing"));
        System.out.println(s.executeUpdate("insert into t values (1, 2) on conflict do nothing"));
    }
    finally {
        s.executeUpdate("drop table t");
    }
}
```

This prints:

```
1
1
```

But I would have expected:

```
1
0
```

`Error: Binder Error: Referenced table "unnamed_subquery1" not found!` in UNPIVOT with a SELECT expression
### What happens?

When performing an UNPIVOT on a SELECT expression (rather than just a table name, as in the [examples](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/unpivot#unpivot-manually), duckdb gives the following error:
```
Error: Binder Error: Referenced table "unnamed_subquery1" not found!
Candidate tables: "unnamed_subquery8"
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE monthly_sales(empid INT, dept TEXT, Jan INT, Feb INT, Mar INT, Apr INT, May INT, Jun INT);
INSERT INTO monthly_sales VALUES
(1, 'electronics', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
(2, 'clothes', 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),
(3, 'cars', 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600);

-- works as intended
UNPIVOT monthly_sales
    ON jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun
    INTO
        NAME month
        VALUE sales;

-- complains about missing unnamed_subquery
UNPIVOT (SELECT * FROM monthly_sales)
    ON jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun
    INTO
        NAME month
        VALUE sales;
```

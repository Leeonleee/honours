Cannot insert into a UNION with two structs without using the `union_value` function
### What happens?

Cannot insert into a UNION with two structs without using the `union_value` function.  Both unnamed and named structs don't work.

### To Reproduce

```
create table t3 (id integer, u union(s1 struct(f1 string, f2 int), s2 struct(b1 string)));
```
```
D insert into t3 values (1, row('a'));
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(VARCHAR) does not match with STRUCT(f1 VARCHAR, f2 INTEGER). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
LINE 1: insert into t3 values (1, row('a'));
                                  ^
D insert into t3 values (1, row('a', 3));
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(VARCHAR, INTEGER) does not match with STRUCT(b1 VARCHAR). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
LINE 1: insert into t3 values (1, row('a', 3));
                                  ^
D insert into t3 values (1, {b1: 'a'});
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(b1 VARCHAR) does not match with STRUCT(f1 VARCHAR, f2 INTEGER). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
LINE 1: insert into t3 values (1, {b1: 'a'})
                                   ^
```

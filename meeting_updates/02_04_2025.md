# Meeting Updates

## Completed
- Successfully cloned rocksDB
- Successfully went to older commit, and compiled
- Successfully ran the given code that causes errors

## In Progress
- Working on trying to get the test file to compile
- Once that is done, I'll switch to the fixed code and run the test again to see the difference
- Then find some more issues, and repeat
- After ~5 issues I can try to write a script

## Meeting Notes
- Identify how to just run single tests
    - Take a look at the makefile
- Identify applying the fix with just the patch
- Have a look at the SWE-Bench code and see if we can reuse some of it
- Use oracle for now to make it as easy as possible
- Find other PRs by findings ones that touch the test files

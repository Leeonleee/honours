# Meeting Updates

## Completed
- Successfully compiled and ran single test
- Successfully applied test and code fix using patch
- Successfully did fail/pass test run

- Used the same prompt template as the one in SWE Bench to test the prompts
- Didn't have API keys, so I just used ChatGPT for now
- I made GPT generate a patch instead, and modified my script to apply the patch and run the new test on the code
- The patch got the line numbers wrong (said line 3111 was modified but that doesn't exist?) so the patch wasn't applied successfully
- Did another one, and it was just the wrong change
- Script seems to work though, the script will go to the prefix, patch the test, run the test on the old code (should fail), apply the llm_fix.patch, and run the test against it
## In Progress

## Meeting Notes
- Find a way to simplify what we're asking for to give it a chance to work
    - Maybe change repo, change issues, try different models
- 
- Fake a simple compilation error right now
- Look at the models that are doing well
- Try anthropic 

- Try look at the code to scrape GitHub issues

- Literature review: have some sort of narrative

- Here's a line of research, heres are works that follow that line of research
- Here's how they come together/how my work combines these 2 or contrasts. How do I build on them
- Show i've done the reading, I understand the area, and how my work is influenced but different
- Getting that narrative/theme/research ideas that im following is the main thing that should drive the structure
    - Order papers from oldest to newest
    - Group papers by area as well

- Find papers about the difficulties of developing in systems languages
    - Differences in context needed
    - WHy is C/C++ different to Python

# Meeting Updates
## Questions
- What do I write for evaluation plan
- Having trouble finding papers about LLMs being bad at C/C++
- Having trouble finding papers about C/C++ being inherently more difficult that Python
- A lot of the papers that I'm citing I can only find on Arxiv, but they're cited by the papers I had in A1, which are published\
    - A lot of the newer benchmarks are also not published
- Does my topic count as a new research topic? what are the word count expectations
- Do I need more than 1 research question? The current one covers pretty much everything I'll be doing. Do I need to break it down into smaller ones?
    - What metrics and evaluation criteria are most appropriate for assessing LLM-generated C/C++ code?
    - "Is C/C++ programming more difficult than Python for LLM?"
    - How can performance considerations be incorporated into benchmarking frameworks for database systems?
- How analytical do I need to be for each section?
    - Introduction of benchmarks doesn't seem too analytical
- How do I plan to evaluate my contributions?
## Completed
- Mainly working on assignment 2
## In Progress

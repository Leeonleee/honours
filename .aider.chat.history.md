run_aider.py

A small convenience wrapper that invokes the ``aider`` CLI on a provided
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) file.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/aider_scripts/run_aider.py path/to/cla.txt

The script:
1. Validates exactly one CLI argument is supplied.
2. Confirms the supplied path exists.
3. Delegates execution to the ``aider`` executable, forwarding the CLA file path.

run_aider.py

A small convenience wrapper that invokes the ``aider`` CLI on a provided
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) file.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/aider_scripts/run_aider.py path/to/cla.txt

The script:
1. Validates exactly one CLI argument is supplied.
2. Confirms the supplied path exists.
3. Delegates execution to the ``aider`` executable, forwarding the CLA file path.

#### Respond below:  

I need to update the implementation of `ListVector::Search`, which lives in the source file that defines list-vector behaviour (commonly something like `src/vector/list_vector.cpp`).  
That file isn’t in the chat yet, so I can’t propose the concrete *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits.

Please add the full path(s) and contents of the file(s) that contain:

• `class ListVector` (or the function `ListVector::Search`)  
• The `PhysicalType` enum (if it is in a different header/source file and you want edits there)

Once those files are in the chat, I’ll provide the precise patches to add the missing `INTERVAL` handling.

I need the current contents of  
a/src/common/types/vector.cpp  
in order to add the missing INTERVAL handling.

Please add that file’s full contents to the chat so I can prepare the precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits.

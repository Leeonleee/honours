<issue>
FLUSHALL during slot migration causes assert failure
```cpp
auto DashTable<_Key, _Value, Policy>::Traverse(Cursor curs, Cb&& cb) -> Cursor {
  ...

  // We fix bid and go over all segments. Once we reach the end we increase bid and repeat.
  do {
    SegmentType* s = segment_[sid];
    assert(s);
```

Open questions:
1. Should we forbid running FLUSHALL when a migration takes place?
2. Could this `assert` happen also in other flows / scenarios?
</issue>

I need you to solve the provided issue by generating a code fix that can be applied directly to the repository

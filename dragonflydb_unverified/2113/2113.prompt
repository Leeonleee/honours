You will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.

<issue>
`StringMap` could crash with `operator+=`
The reason is that, if some elements expired, we may call `Advance()` after we've reached the end.
A repro test:

```cpp
TEST_F(StringMapTest, TtlLoop) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(sm_->AddOrUpdate("k1", "v1", 1));
  EXPECT_TRUE(sm_->AddOrUpdate("k2", "v2", 1));
  sm_->set_time(1);
  auto it = sm_->begin();
  it += 1;
}
```

This affects all calls to `RandomPair()`, including `HRANDFIELD`

I need you to solve the provided issue by generating a code fix that can be applied directly to the repository

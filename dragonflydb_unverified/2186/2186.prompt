<issue>
improper handling of JSON path "."
**Describe the bug**
The current behavior is to treat a JSON path of "." as "$" for compatibility with tools like RedisInsight and official Redis libraries; however, this is different from the way Redis itself handles the legacy path ".".

**To Reproduce**

**Redis**

> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET doc $ '{"a":2}'
> OK
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc
> {"a":2}
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc $
> [{"a":2}]
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc .
> {"a":2}

**Dragonfly**

> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET doc $ '{"a":2}'
> OK
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc
> {"a":2}
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc $
> [{"a":2}]
> 127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.GET doc .
> [{"a":2}]

**Expected behavior**
Providing a path of "." should give the same output as not providing a path at all. This would increase compatibility with RedisInsight and official Redis libraries.

I'm not as intimately familiar with other Redis libraries but redis-py automatically adds a path of "." if no path is provided. This is causing compatibility issues with using Dragonfly as a drop-in replacement since `redis.json().get("key")` is always returning a list due to the implied "." path.

<issue>
support ACL for database ids
Introduce a (dragonfly specific) ACL rule that restricts a user to a specific database id.

so if they use a connection string  `rediss://myuser:pass@hostname/1` but `myuser` is only allowed on DB 42 then this will be rejected with auth rejected error. Similarly, `select x` will be rejected if `x ` is not allowed.

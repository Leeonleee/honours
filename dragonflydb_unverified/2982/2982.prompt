bug: error while parsing aclfile
**Describe the bug**

Receiving an error `acl_family.cc:271 Error while parsing aclfile: Unrecognized parameter >mypassword` while using an known valid ACL file. 

```bash
"USER local-testing.rot-1 ON >mypassword resetkeys ~mykey* +set +get +del +ping"
``` 

**To Reproduce**
1. Create an ACL file with the contents above
2. Deploy on Kubernetes with Dragonfly DB operator v.1.1.2
3. View the logs of the StatefulSet
4. See error: `acl_family.cc:271 Error while parsing aclfile`

**Expected behavior**
File should be loaded successfully, according to your [documentation](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/managing-dragonfly/acl#passwords) `>` should be supported.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - Containerized?: Kubernetes
 - Dragonfly Version: v1.17.1

**Additional context**
The bug may have been introduced here: https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly/pull/2123

According to the [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl/#acl-rules
) `>` is used for plaintext passwords where as `#` is used for a hash value.  
```
Configure valid passwords for the user:

><password>: Add this password to the list of valid passwords for the user. For example >mypass will add "mypass" to the list of valid passwords. This directive clears the nopass flag (see later). Every user can have any number of passwords.
<<password>: Remove this password from the list of valid passwords. Emits an error in case the password you are trying to remove is actually not set.
#<hash>: Add this SHA-256 hash value to the list of valid passwords for the user. This hash value will be compared to the hash of a password entered for an ACL user. This allows users to store hashes in the acl.conf file rather than storing cleartext passwords. Only SHA-256 hash values are accepted as the password hash must be 64 characters and only contain lowercase hexadecimal characters.
```

**Non Relevant**
This is a really cool project and I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into it.  Keep up the great work!

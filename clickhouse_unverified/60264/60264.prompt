Request WHERE toHour(stamp, 'America/NewYork')  is not consistent with the result of toHour(stamp) 
Hello guys,

Using CH (23.9.2.56)

I have a really weird behavior on my ReplicatedMergeTree table (requested through a distributed table).
So I have a table like Table (stamp DateTime('UTC'), clicks UInt64),
And when I :
```
SELECT toHour(stamp, 'America/New_York'), sum(clicks)
FROM mytable
WHERE toDate(stamp, 'America/New_York') = '2024-02-01'
GROUP BY ALL;
```
I get something like (the numbers are made up, but it is a huge traffic table)

|  stamp(America/NewYork) | clicks  |
|---|---|
|  0 |  34   |
|  1 |   45  |
|  2 |  60  |
|  ... |   ... |
|  7 |   207 |
|  8 |   213 |

At 7AM (NY time) for example I get : sum(clicks) => 207.

But when I do a more precise request like just adding  AND toHour(stamp, 'America/NewYork') = 7:
```
SELECT toHour(stamp, 'America/New_York'), sum(clicks)
FROM mytable
WHERE toDate(stamp, 'America/New_York') = '2024-02-01'
AND toHour(stamp, 'America/New_York') = 7 
GROUP BY ALL;
```

I Have a different result like sum(clicks) => 93 :

|  stamp(America/NewYork) | clicks  |
|---|---|
|  7 |  93   |

But If I remove the 'America/New_York' and do the request in UTC time (7AM = 12 PM) the result stay consistent.

```
SELECT toHour(stamp, 'America/New_York'), sum(clicks)
FROM mytable
WHERE toDate(stamp, 'America/New_York') = '2024-02-01'
AND toHour(stamp) = 12 
GROUP BY ALL;
```

**How to reproduce**

Using Using CH (23.9.2.56)

- CREATE TABLE db.table_local ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'
(
    `stamp` DateTime('UTC'),
    ..... a lot of others column ....
    `clicks` UInt64 
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree
PARTITION BY toDate(stamp)

-  CREATE TABLE db.table_local ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'
(
    `stamp` DateTime('UTC'),
    ..... a lot of others column ....
    `clicks` UInt64 
)
ENGINE = Distributed('db', 'db', 'table', rand())

- send a lot of request (some millions)
- then request playing on the where with the toHour function

**Expected behavior**

The data should be consistent using toHour(stamp, 'someplace') and without the someplace

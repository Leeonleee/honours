Cast bug
Received exception: DB::Exception: Second argument to CAST must be a constant string describing type (version 19.17.2.4 (official build))
`select cast(1 as String)`
`from (select 1 as iid) as t1`
`join (select '1' as sid) as t2 on t2.sid = cast(t1.iid as String)`

On version 19.4.5.1 this query works fine.

Also if I change some parts in this query it will be work without exceptions, for example:
`select cast(1 as Date)` -- or another type except String
`from (select 1 as iid) as t1`
`join (select '1' as sid) as t2 on t2.sid = cast(t1.iid as String)`

`select cast(1 as String)`
`from (select 1 as iid) as t1`

`select cast(1 as String)` -- or another type
`from (select 1 as iid) as t1`
`join (select '1' as sid) as t2 on cast(t2.sid as UInt8) = t1.iid`

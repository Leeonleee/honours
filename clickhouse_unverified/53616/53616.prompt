Skip indexes and functions and dropped granules
-- granularity 100
```sql
ClickHouse local version 23.6.2.18 (official build).

create table test (K Int64,  A Int64, B Int64, C Int64, 
index x1 (greatest(A,B,C)) type minmax granularity 100) 
Engine=MergeTree order by K as select number,0,0,0 from numbers(1e7);

select count() from test where greatest(A,B,C) >0;

Index `x1` has dropped 15/1221 granules.


select count() from test where greatest(A,B,C)!=0;

Index `x1` has dropped 15/1221 granules.
```

why only 15 granules is dropped?

-- granularity 1
```sql
create table test (K Int64,  A Int64, B Int64, C Int64, 
index x1 (greatest(A,B,C)) type minmax granularity 1) 
Engine=MergeTree order by K as select number,0,0,0 from numbers(1e7);

select count() from test where greatest(A,B,C) >0;
Index `x1` has dropped 1221/1221 granules.
```

it seems it's a statistics/show issue.


```sql
create table test (K Int64,  A Int64, B Int64, C Int64, 
index x1 (A>0,B>0,C>0) type set(2) granularity 1000) 
Engine=MergeTree order by K as select number,0,0,0 from numbers(1e8);

select count() from test where A>0 and B>0 and C>0;

Index `x1` has dropped 14/12209 granules.
Selected 5/5 parts by partition key, 0 parts by primary key, 12209/12209 marks by primary key, 0 marks to read from 0 ranges
```
why set type index should invalidï¼Œbut the explain shows Selected Granules is less than Initial Granules
i have a big data table, there is a column with non-repetitive datas. there is a set type index on this column. the max_rows was set 100.( index_granularity = 8192, and GRANULARITY of the index is 16. so i think the row number is 131072, is bigger than max_rows which be set as 100,  so as the official document said, this index should be invalid )
but where i execute explain indexes = 1, it show, after using this index ,Selected Granules is less than Initial Granules, it shows the index is valid, so im confused about this.

the explain info of this index :
                                          "Type": "Skip",
                                          "Name": "a",
                                          "Description": "set GRANULARITY 16",
                                          "Initial Parts": 8,
                                          "Selected Parts": 8,
                                          "Initial Granules": 41323,
                                          "Selected Granules": 3201

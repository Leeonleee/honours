Cached MySQL Dictionary tries to use derived table:  Code: 1000, e.code() = 1248 Every derived table must have its own alias
**Describe what's wrong**

This may be a regression as it started happening when I upgraded from 23.8 to 24.3. **Cache dictionaries with a MySQL source fail on dictGet**. Hashed dictionaries on the same data source still work the same as before

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Happens on latest LTS release: 24.3.3.
Not happening on 23.8.x.

**How to reproduce**

```clickhouse
CREATE OR REPLACE DICTIONARY dict_monolith_user ON CLUSTER `analytics`
(
    tenantid     Int32,
    id           String,
    display_name String,
    first_name   String,
    last_name    String,
    is_bot       UInt8,
    suspeded_at  DateTime
)
    PRIMARY KEY tenantid, id
    SOURCE (
        MYSQL(
                NAME monolith_mysql
                query
                'SELECT tenantid, id, COALESCE(NULLIF(CONCAT_WS(" ", firstname, lastname),""), name) as display_name, firstname as first_name, lastname as last_name, is_bot, suspended_at FROM `user`'
        )
        )
    LAYOUT (COMPLEX_KEY_CACHE(SIZE_IN_CELLS 500000))
    LIFETIME (3600);
```

```clickhouse
 SELECT dictGet('dict_monolith_user', 'display_name', (909, 'a'));
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

Error is:

```
Code: 510. DB::Exception: Update failed for dictionary 'default.dict_monolith_user (1d15a9c5-2251-43ca-8029-49267d9fdb95)': Code: 510. DB::Exception: Update failed for dictionary default.dict_monolith_user (1d15a9c5-2251-43ca-8029-49267d9fdb95) : Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 1248, mysqlxx::BadQuery: Every derived table must have its own alias while executing query: 'SELECT * FROM (SELECT tenantid, id, COALESCE(NULLIF(CONCAT_WS(" ", firstname, lastname),""), name) as display_name, firstname as first_name, lastname as last_name, is_bot, suspended_at FROM `user`) WHERE (`tenantid`=909 AND `id`='a');' (db-read-replica-1.development:3306),. (CACHE_DICTIONARY_UPDATE_FAIL) (version 24.3.3.102 (official build))
```

Seems like the dictionary tries to use a derived table style query without an alias.

JSONCompact output format can emit unparsable JSON
**Describe what's wrong**

The `JSONCompact` format can produce unparsable JSON when the last value output ends with a byte between `0xf0` and `0xf7`.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**How to reproduce**

 Running the query:

```
SELECT unhex('f0') FORMAT JSONCompact
```

Outputs
```
{
	"meta":
	[
		{
			"name": "unhex('f0')",
			"type": "String"
		}
	],

	"data":
	[
		["ï¿½
	],

	"rows": 1,

	"statistics":
	{
		"elapsed": 0.000510458,
		"rows_read": 1,
		"bytes_read": 1
	}
}
```

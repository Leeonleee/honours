skip_unavailable_shards is not working as expected
```sql
-- This works as expected.
SELECT count()
FROM remote('{127,1}.0.0.{2,3}', system.one)
SETTINGS skip_unavailable_shards = 1

┌─count()─┐
│       2 │
└─────────┘

-- However if we change the pattern so that the first host in unavailable it will fail.
SELECT count()
FROM remote('{1,127}.0.0.{2,3}', system.one)
SETTINGS skip_unavailable_shards = 1

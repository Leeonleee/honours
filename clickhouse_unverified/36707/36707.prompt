22.4 Vertical merges of wide parts are broken
Vertical merges of wide parts fail if there is an array in the table and not all columns are present in parts.
```sql
CREATE TABLE aaa 
(
  a   Array(Int16),
  b   Int8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY tuple() 
settings
    vertical_merge_algorithm_min_columns_to_activate=1,
    vertical_merge_algorithm_min_rows_to_activate=1,
    min_bytes_for_wide_part=0;

insert into aaa select [], 0;
alter table aaa clear column b;

optimize table aaa final;

Received exception from server (version 22.4.2):
Code: 16. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. 
DB::Exception: There is no column a.size0 in table. (NO_SUCH_COLUMN_IN_TABLE)

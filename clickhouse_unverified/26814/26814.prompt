21.5.8, 21.6 & 21.7 break *Array aggregation types
Updating existing table to 21.6 and 21.7 breaks *Array aggregation types. The table contains mater view with the following column

````
strings AggregateFunction(topKArray(10), Array(String)),
````

When trying to insert into the table I get the following error:

```
Conversion from AggregateFunction(topKArray, Array(String)) to AggregateFunction(topKArray(10), Array(String)) is not supported
```

As you see the type has changed from `topKArray(10)` to `topKArray`. I can update the mater view schema to use the new type and the problem goes away, but it is not clear whether this change was intentional because only `*Array` agg functions are affected.

It is the same with `groupUniqArrayArray` and even worse, because I can't cast `groupUniqArrayArray(1000)` to `groupUniqArrayArray`:

```
MODIFY COLUMN strings AggregateFunction(groupUniqArrayArray, Array(String))

Conversion from AggregateFunction(groupUniqArrayArray(1000), Array(String)) to AggregateFunction(groupUniqArrayArray, Array(String)) is not supported
```

The last working version is 21.5.7.9. The next 21.5.8 version is broken.

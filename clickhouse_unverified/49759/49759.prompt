Function to convert IPv6 to appropriate IPv4/6 string?
Following on from #19518, it would be nice to have a reverse function which operates on an ipv6 address and returns it in ipv4 or ipv6 notation depending on type. So basically `replaceOne(IPv6NumToString(ip), '::ffff:', '')`. This should then allow the `IPv6` type to work pretty much the same as the postgres `inet` type I think?

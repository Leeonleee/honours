Provide fromDaysSinceYearZero()
#54856 (respectively #54796) added function [toDaysSinceYearZero()](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions#todayssinceyearzero). The main reason to add this function was to have something similar as MySQL's [TO_DAYS()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_to-days) in ClickHouse (besides that, there is probably little practical use for the function).

As per https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54856#issuecomment-1751765802, we should provide the opposite function for consistency, i.e. `fromDaysSinceYearZero()`. See related `from*()` [date/time functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions) for starting points.

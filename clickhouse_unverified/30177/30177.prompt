initializeAggregation doesn't work with nullable types
**Describe what's wrong**

It's not possible to initialize aggregation function from nullable types.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes, 
ClickHouse version 21.10

```
SELECT initializeAggregation('uniqExactState', toNullable(''))


0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.

Received exception from server (version 21.10.1):
Code: 43. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Nested type AggregateFunction(uniqExact, String) cannot be inside Nullable type: While processing initializeAggregation('uniqExactState', toNullable('')). (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)


SELECT initializeAggregation('uniqExactState', toNullable(1))


Received exception from server (version 21.10.1):
Code: 43. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Nested type AggregateFunction(uniqExact, UInt8) cannot be inside Nullable type: While processing initializeAggregation('uniqExactState', toNullable(1)). (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)
```


**Expected behavior**

It should be possible to initialize aggregation function from nullable types.


**Additional context**

WA

```
SELECT arrayReduce('uniqExactState', [toNullable('')])

Query id: 29fc6760-78be-4f28-be5f-f1bbe12f04fc

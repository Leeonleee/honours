Using Merge table engine and FINAL, columns specified in PREWHERE clause and not specified in SELECT section produces error
**Describe the unexpected behavior**
When using MaterializedMySQL database engine and Merge table engine, columns specified in `WHERE` clause and not specified in `SELECT` section produces error:
```
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column column2 in block. (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)
```

**How to reproduce**

versions:
MySQL: Ver 8.0.28 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
ClickHouse: ClickHouse server version 22.2.2.1

In MySQL:
```
create database db4;

CREATE TABLE db4.table_1 (
    id INT,
    column1 VARCHAR(10),
    column2 VARCHAR(10),
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
	KEY `table_1_column2_index` (`column2`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

insert into db4.table_1 
(id, column1,column2) 
VALUES 
(1, 'abc', 'def');


CREATE TABLE db4.table_2 (
    id INT,
    column1 VARCHAR(10),
    column2 VARCHAR(10),
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
	KEY `table_2_column2_index` (`column2`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

insert into db4.table_2 
(id, column1, column2) 
VALUES 
(2, 'uvw','xyz');
```

In ClickHouse:
```
set allow_experimental_database_materialized_mysql = 1;
CREATE DATABASE db4_mysql ENGINE = MaterializedMySQL('192.168.1.248:3306', 'db4', 'clickhouse_user', 'ClickHouse_123');

create database db5_merge;

CREATE TABLE db5_merge.merge_table
 as db4_mysql.table_1
     ENGINE = Merge('db4_mysql', '^table_\\d+$');
```

**Expected behavior**
query should be able to be executed with a different column specified than what is in `WHERE` clause:
```
ch_env_2 :) select column1 from db5_merge.merge_table where column2 = 'def';

SELECT column1
FROM db5_merge.merge_table
WHERE column2 = 'def'

Query id: 72c41db0-9006-4200-bbbb-d626aa1a9d9b

┌─column1─┐
│ abc     │
└─────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.038 sec.
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
ch_env_2 :) select column1 from db5_merge.merge_table where column2 = 'def';

SELECT column1
FROM db5_merge.merge_table
WHERE column2 = 'def'

Query id: f93bb8d4-8586-4b4f-8b6d-e1c2bc04b114


0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.011 sec.

Received exception from server (version 22.2.2):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column column2 in block. (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)
```

**Additional context**
Found the current behavior and workarounds:
1.  add the column that you would like to use in the where clause to the `SELECT` portion if the query.
2. remove the index key from the column you'd like to use in the `WHERE` portion of the query.

thanks.
Improve usability of `Merge` tables
Currently, a `Merge` table takes the structure of the first (any) table.

Why don't take the union of columns of all tables and convert different types of identically named columns to the least supertype?

Additionally, we can allow inserts into Merge tables. They can be directed to the first table (if any), which data structure fits. A better option - among the tables with fitting data structures, insert to the table with the lexicographically greatest name (this allows usage of Merge tables for schema evolution, such as changing ORDER keys).

**Motivation**

```
clickhouse-cloud :) SELECT sum(cityHash64(*)) FROM merge('^text_log')

SELECT sum(cityHash64(*))
FROM merge('^text_log')

Query id: a594ec22-fe6a-476f-aacf-78ad7fdc4999


Elapsed: 0.246 sec. 

Received exception from server (version 24.5.1):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from kng4alm55c.us-east-2.aws.clickhouse-staging.com:9440. DB::Exception: Column `value1` not found in table default.text_log_10290440206184588366 (68320d6d-b8bc-4883-8fa3-9114c2a9ccdf). (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)

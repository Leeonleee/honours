Segfault while running query with formatRow
**Describe what's wrong**

Running the following query against the HTTP endpoint will cause clickhouse to segfault:
```
SELECT formatRow('JSONEachRow', number) as test FROM (SELECT number FROM numbers(1000000))
```
When you run with less numbers it will not crash but give weird results:
```
❯ curl http://localhost:8123 -d "SELECT formatRow('JSONEachRow', number) as test FROM (SELECT number FROM numbers(15))"
{"number":"0"}\n
{"number":"1"}\n
{"number":"2"}\n
{"number":"3"}\n
{"number":"4"}\n
{"number":"5"}\n
{"number":"6"}\n
{"number":"7"}\n
{"number":"8"}\n
{"number":"9"}\n
{"number":"10"}\n
{"number":"11"}\0
\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0��
���\0\0��|���\0\0\0\0\0
\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
```

Running the query with clickhouse-client seems to work fine.

Using `FORMAT` also works fine:
```
❯ curl http://localhost:8123 -d "SELECT number FROM numbers(100000) FORMAT JSONEachRow"
...
{"number":"99998"}
{"number":"99999"}
```

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes.

**How to reproduce**

Run the latest image
```
docker run -p 8123:8123 clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest
```
Then run the query using the HTTP endpoint:
```
curl http://localhost:8123 -d "SELECT formatRow('JSONEachRow', number) as test FROM (SELECT number FROM numbers(1000000))"
```

As soon as you run it, the container will exit with exit code 139.

CREATE TABLE hits2 AS hits

Query id: ef73b907-c73b-42ba-8194-db88c88cc85b

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.024 sec. 

milovidov-desktop :) INSERT INTO hits2 FROM INFILE 'hits.tsv'

INSERT INTO hits2 FROM INFILE 'hits.tsv'

Query id: 0588941e-ff9e-4741-97ce-7784aee1e253

â†“ Progress: 0.00 rows, 0.00 B (0.00 rows/s., 0.00 B/s.)
```

Two problems:
- no progress;
- it is displaying a fractional number of rows (`0.00`).

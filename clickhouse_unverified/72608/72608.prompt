ARRAY JOIN alias recognition broken in production analyzer
Version: Latest LTS (24.8)

Something seems wrong with `ARRAY JOIN [arrayColName] AS [itemAlias]` when `allow_experimental_analyzer=1` which seems to be the default behavior in the latest LTS version (24.8)

```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS reprodb;

USE reprodb;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS repro
(
   "a" LowCardinality(String),
   "foos" Nested(
      "x" LowCardinality(String),
   )
) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY a;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS repro_dist
(
   "a" LowCardinality(String),
   "foos" Nested(
      "x" LowCardinality(String),
   )
) ENGINE = Distributed('repro-cluster', 'reprodb', 'repro');
```

Query with default (same result using explicit setting for allow_experimental_analyzer=1)
```
SELECT
    a,
    foo.x
FROM repro_dist
ARRAY JOIN foos AS foo

Query id: e7d46628-68d7-450f-b24f-6fd5788f50e0
Elapsed: 0.010 sec.
Received exception from server (version 24.8.3):

DB::Exception: Unknown expression identifier 'foo'. In scope SELECT __table2.a AS a, getSubcolumn(foo AS foo, 'x') AS `foo.x` FROM reprodb.repro AS __table2 ARRAY JOIN foo. Maybe you meant: ['foo']. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
```

Query with `allow_experimental_analyzer=0`
```
SELECT
    a,
    foo.x
FROM repro_dist
ARRAY JOIN foos AS foo
SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 0

Query id: 6a8c296b-6ac5-44b1-8842-5b7671627889

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.007 sec.
```

Note: this doesn't seem to happen for direct querying of `MergeTree`, just the distributed equivalent.
```
select a, foo.x from repro array join foos as foo settings  allow_experimental_analyzer=1;

SELECT
    a,
    foo.x
FROM repro
ARRAY JOIN foos AS foo
SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 1

Query id: 0e4b4fc4-843c-48d4-8096-b56ccf6fa949

Ok.
```

Note: this might be specific to nested?
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS repro_without_nest
(
   "a" LowCardinality(String),
   "foos" Array(LowCardinality(String))
) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY a;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS repro_without_nest_dist
(
   "a" LowCardinality(String),
   "foos" Array(LowCardinality(String))
) ENGINE = Distributed('repro-cluster', 'reprodb', 'repro_without_nest');

SELECT
    a,
    foo
FROM repro_without_nest_dist
ARRAY JOIN foos AS foo
SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 1

Query id: e6443d83-4395-4381-99d0-c67705b69112

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.007 sec.
```

This looks a bit suspect:
```
Unknown expression identifier 'foo'. ... Maybe you meant: ['foo']. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
```

The fragment around getSubColumn looks like maybe the wrong arg is passed?
```
...In scope SELECT __table2.a AS a, getSubcolumn(foo AS foo, 'x') AS `foo.x` FROM...
```

Maybe this needs to be something like this (a sketch, probably wrong), but you get the idea:
```
SELECT __table2.a AS a, getSubcolumn(__table2.foos, 'x') AS 'foo.x' FROM...
```

Edit: yeah, here's what I assume is the internal representation of the query that is generated from the raw input, which results in the error about the identifier
```
SELECT
    __table2.a AS a,
    getSubcolumn(foo AS foo, 'x') AS `foo.x`
FROM reprodb.repro AS __table2
ARRAY JOIN foos

...DB::Exception: Unknown expression or function identifier 'foo'...
```

And here's my manual "correction" that seems to work
```
SELECT
    __table2.a AS a,
    getSubcolumn(__table2.foos, 'x') AS `foo.x`
FROM reprodb.repro AS __table2
ARRAY JOIN foos

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
```

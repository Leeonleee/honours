DB::Exception: Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream: different columns (Const)
This simple view:

```
CREATE VIEW test.bug_const AS
SELECT 'World' AS hello
FROM (SELECT number FROM system.numbers LIMIT 1) AS n1
JOIN (SELECT number FROM system.numbers LIMIT 1) AS n2 USING (number)
```

is created ok, but at SELECT time throws the following exception:

> Received exception from server (version 20.4.3):
> Code: 171. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream: different columns:
> hello String String(size = 0)
> hello String Const(size = 0, String(size = 1)). 

If I execute the SELECT part as as standalone query, it works, but in a VIEW it does not.

On complex views, joining other views many levels deep, this bug appears on all 20.3 and 20.4 versions of Clickhouse I tried, including 20.3.10.75, 20.4.2.9 and 20.4.3.16. But the simple way to reproduce it that I posted above only triggers the bug on 20.4 versions.

Branch 20.1 and previous ones seem to be OK.

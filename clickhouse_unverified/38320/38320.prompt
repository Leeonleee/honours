Hung check: slow JSON deserialization
https://s3.amazonaws.com/clickhouse-test-reports/0/0b8fc627d80013c0288ddf5a7d91546a7d9d6264/stress_test__debug__actions_.html

Seems like `SerializationObject<DB::JSONDataParser<DB::SimdJSONParser> >::deserializeWholeText` may be too slow, so it triggers Hung Check in Stress Tests sometimes. Probably it's because of `getLeastSupertype`.

I would ignore it if it was the only failure, but there's another one with similar stacktrace:

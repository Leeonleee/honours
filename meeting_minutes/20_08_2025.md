# Meeting Updates

## Questions

- I've tested out a bunch of repos (ClickHouse, Oceanbase, DragonflyDB)
  - The easiest I found to test was DragonflyDB
  - However, only the ~5 most recent PRs compile without issue
  - Do you think it would be better to try get the older problems to compile, or to just use the 5 and find other repos that work, and get ~5 from those as well
    - If I get ~5 from multiple, I guess it shows more compatibility with many repos, but then those wouldn't be that useful for benchmarking purposes because there won't be a wide variety of problems

## Meeting Notes

- Use the 7 dragonflydb problems to show extensibility, but focus results analysis on DuckDB
- Maybe checkout the other repos (not DBMS focus)

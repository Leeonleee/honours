## Questions

## Completed

- Ran through initial issues manually since the script was taking a very long time
    - Encountered some issues with aider:
        - Sometimes if I just provide the file that was modified in the PR, it asks for me to manually add more files
            - For this, I think I could possible just count it as a failed case? Since I'm testing the oracle case right now
            - Occurred for 5690 once and not for the other issues
        - For one of the issues it tried to include a file that didn't exist. Quite weird because Aider has access to the repo, but I'll probably need to look more into how the repo map works

## In Progress

## Meeting Notes

- Exit code to check if test is valid
    - 0 if everything passed
    - Non zero if there is a failure $? in bashA
- Check the other 2 models to see if the problems are failing consistently between all models
- git diff each change after applying it
- For error analysis
    - See where models fail across problems
    - See if models fail on the same thing across multiple problems

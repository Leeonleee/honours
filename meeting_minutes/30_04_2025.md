# Meeting Updates

## Questions

## Completed

- Switched from RocksDB to DuckDB as it worked better with the SWE-bench scraping
- Found a bunch of valid issues, and wrote a script to get the easy ones
- Wrote scripts to turn each PR json into a fix.patch, test.patch, and .prompt file
- Got one issue that is simple enough, and got o3 (web) to successfully generate a valid patch. I applied the patch, recompiled, and it fixed the bug and the test passed.
  - So the main issue now is:
    - Models still struggle with generating the correct code, and also generating a valid patch

## In Progress

- Working through the easy issues to reproduce them
  - This is taking a bit of time because the older issues don't compile, and the compilation takes forever
- The closest I've had to something that looks correct is PR #5805. The code generated looks fully correct
  - The patch had some errors where the lines changed number didn't match the actual number of lines changed. I couldn't get it working with the API, but with web o3 it worked first try and successfully fixed the issue
  - The build doesn't work though without manual changes:

```

- I think this is caused by the current compiler on my laptop being newer so it's more strict on missing headers. My laptop is GCC 13, and online I saw people say `cstdint` is included in `iostream` on GCC 12 and lower
  - Not too sure how to deal with this
  - I can manually fix it just for this PR, but it occurs in all the old PRs

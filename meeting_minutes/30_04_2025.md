# Meeting Updates

## Questions

## Completed

- Switched from RocksDB to DuckDB as it worked better with the SWE-bench scraping
- Found a bunch of valid issues, and wrote a script to get the easy ones
- Wrote scripts to turn each PR json into a fix.patch, test.patch, and .prompt file

## In Progress

- Working through the easy issues to reproduce them
  - This is taking a bit of time because the older issues don't compile, and the compilation takes forever
- The closest I've had to something that looks correct is PR #5805
  - The build doesn't work though

# Meeting Updates

## Questions

- For the results where I'm not comparing between thinking modes, I'm using the default settings, so not specifying any thinking tokens
  - I'm not 100% sure if the models use any thinking/reasoning if I do that
  - From some of the output I checked, it seems like it may be, but I'm not 100% sure because when I provide an explicit thinking token count, the output shows a Thinking section

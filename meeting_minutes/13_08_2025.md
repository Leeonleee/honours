# Meeting Updates

## Questions

- Exit codes for Aider aren't very useful
  - Exit code 2: unrecognised argument
  - Exit code 0: success, api key error, chat context too large

- The fix.patch in most ydb problems are very long
  - Also their tests run using their own Ya Make. Not sure if I should bother with it
- I'm trying ClickHouse now, but I noticed their tests are Python. This isn't a big deal for running the tests, but I should exclude any problems that modify Python files in the fix PRright? I only want to test C/C++ code generation

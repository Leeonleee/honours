# Meeting Updates

## Questions

## Completed

- Modified prompt to tell the model to only include the prompt file outputs

## In Progress

- Working on presentation
- Still dealing with the `<cstdint.h>` error. I tried using GCC 12, and that ended up causing problems when I did `#include <cstdint.h>`, which I had to then fix by replacing it with `#include <stdint.h>`.
  - I googled and apparently it used to be called that in older versions?
- No idea what's causing this though since I thought it was my GCC version being too new, but I went back to 12 and it still doesn't work?
- Worst case I can add `#include <stdint.h>/<cstdint.h>` to every file, but that might not be the only issue I encounter so ideally I can fix it

## Meeting Notes

- Use AWS to test the compilation to see if there are the issues
- Manually fix issues just to get some results
- Research proposal presentation
- Get structure to Michael before Wednesdayf

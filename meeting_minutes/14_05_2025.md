# Meeting Updates

## Questions

- What can I do about the compilation process taking forever?
  - Since I need to `make clean` and `git reset` after each build to ensure a fresh copy of the source code

## Completed

- Created the automated benchmark script
  - Currently DuckDB is kind of hard coded, but I'll eventually adjust it so it works with more repos (once I select them)
- The benchmark will output the logs for each patch file that's generated
  - Also will save the results to a csv file for analysis later

## In Progress

- I'll run the benchmark on more issues and more models

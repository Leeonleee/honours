You will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.
In your output, give nothing but the code (no markdown) so that your output can be copy pasted and run immediately with no changes.
In the patch file, please make sure to include the line numbers and a blank line at the end so it can be applied using git apply.

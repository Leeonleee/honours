Syntax error on vacuum with column names
### What happens?

When running a vacuum on a column in a table a parser error is thrown. This doesn't happen if there is an analyze associated with the vacuum, or if no columns are specified.

### To Reproduce

```sql
create table t1(id int, val int);
vacuum t1(id, val);
vacuum memory.main.t1(id, val);
```

Output
```
D create table t1(id int, val int);
D vacuum t1(id, val);
Error: Parser Error: syntax error at or near "("
LINE 1: vacuum t1(id, val);
                 ^
D vacuum memory.main.t1(id, val);
Error: Parser Error: syntax error at or near "("
LINE 1: vacuum memory.main.t1(id, val);
                             ^
D vacuum analyze memory.main.t1(id, val);
D

EPOCH FROM 'TIMESTAMP with milliseconds' drops millisecond output
### What happens?

The milliseconds portion of the time is dropped when using EPOCH against a timestamp which has milliseconds provided. 


### To Reproduce

`SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM '2001-02-16 20:38:40.12-08'::TIMESTAMP);`
**Result: 982384720** 
Should be: **982384720.120000**

`SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM '2001-02-16 20:38:40.12'::TIMESTAMP);`
**Result: 982355920** 
Should be: **982355920.120000**

`SELECT EPOCH('2001-02-16 20:38:40.12'::TIMESTAMP);`
**Result: 982355920**
Should be: **982355920.120000**

Related info when comparing to PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT under the epoch section.

Also "The extract function returns values of type numeric." in PostgreSQL and looks like DuckDB is returning BIGINT.

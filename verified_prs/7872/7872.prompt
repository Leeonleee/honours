LEFT JOIN UNNEST() requires an ON clause
### What happens?

Sometimes you want to UNNEST with a LEFT JOIN.  Currently you have to provide an ON clause in order to do this.  I have a hacky workaround that I would like to remove.



### To Reproduce

```
with t as (
  select 
    1 as r, 
    [
      {n:1},
      {n:2}
    ] as s
  union   select 
    2 as r, 
    [
      {n:3},
      {n:4}
    ] as s
     
)
select r, s1.s.n from t
LEFT JOIN UNNEST(s) as s1(s)
```

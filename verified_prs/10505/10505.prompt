<issue>
Selecting entire rows fails when the source table is named 'user'
### What happens?

If you select "entire rows" (as in `select foo from foo`), you generally get back each row as a struct. But if the table is named `user`, or if it's aliased to `user` in the query, you get the string `"duckdb"`—at least at the command line.

```sql
with x as (select 1) select foo from x foo;
```
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│         foo         │
│ struct("1" integer) │
├─────────────────────┤
│ {'1': 1}            │
└─────────────────────┘
```
```sql
with x as (select 1) select user from x user;
```
```
┌─────────┐
│  user   │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ duckdb  │
└─────────┘
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
with x as (select 1) select user from x user;
```
```
┌─────────┐
│  user   │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ duckdb  │
└─────────┘
```

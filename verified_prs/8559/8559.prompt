Export/Import issue regarding parquet and ROW_GROUP_SIZE
### What happens?

When try to export with the next command:

EXPORT DATABASE 'target_directory' (FORMAT PARQUET, COMPRESSION ZSTD, ROW_GROUP_SIZE 100000);
the 
IMPORT is not working.

This is a very minor issue
I only want to point out this


See reproduce section:


### To Reproduce

> EXPORT DATABASE 'target_directory' (FORMAT PARQUET, COMPRESSION ZSTD, ROW_GROUP_SIZE 100000);

The import is not working

> import database 'target_directory';
Error: Not implemented Error: Unsupported option for COPY FROM parquet: ROW_GROUP_SIZE

A workaround is to edit the 'load.sql'  command and remove the ROW_GROUP_SIZE

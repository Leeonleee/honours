CSV read, INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 1 within vector of size 1
### What happens?

Hi,
I try to read a big CSV file and I have INTERNAL Error.

### To Reproduce

I cannot attach a sample file, because it's big.

The source is a CSV, with delim=";" https://opencoesione.gov.it/media/open_data//progetti_esteso_20231231.zip

Decompress it and get the top 290k lines:

```bash
progetti_esteso_20231231.zip
<progetti_esteso_20231231.csv head -n 290000 >tmp.csv
```

Then I run

```
duckdb --csv -c "SET preserve_insertion_order=false;SELECT count(*) FROM read_csv_auto('tmp.csv',parallel=false,all_varchar=true)"
```

and I have 

```
Error: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 1 within vector of size 1
```

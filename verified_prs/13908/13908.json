  "problem_statement": "Inconsistent results when casting `BIT` and `VARBINARY`\n### What happens?\n\nConsider the following test case generated by my fuzzer. The second query and the third query could have inconsistent results. I suppose the second query should be consistently `true,true` and the third query should thus be `ab,cd`. \n\n### To Reproduce\n\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE  t1(c0 VARBINARY NOT NULL);\r\nINSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('ab'), ('cd');\r\n-- INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('\ud83e\udd86'); -- error\r\n-- INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (NULL); -- error\r\n\r\nSELECT t1.c0 FROM t1; -- 'ab', 'cd'\r\nSELECT ((CAST(CAST(t1.c0 AS BIT) AS VARBINARY))<=(t1.c0)) FROM t1; -- true, true (incosistent, could sometimes be false, false)\r\nSELECT t1.c0 FROM t1 WHERE ((CAST(CAST(t1.c0 AS BIT) AS VARBINARY))<=(t1.c0));\r\n-- Expected: 'ab', 'cd' (2 rows)\r\n-- Actual: could be 0 row, 1 row or 2 rows\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if the two `INSERT` are needed. Sometimes I could also reproduce it without executing them, but sometimes can't.\r\n\r\nKindly inform me if it's an expected behavior and whether you could reproduce the issue.\n\n### OS:\n\nubuntu 22.04\n\n### DuckDB Version:\n\nv1.1.1-dev100 9af117f0e6\n\n### DuckDB Client:\n\nCLI\n\n### Hardware:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nSuyang Zhong\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nNUS\n\n### What is the latest build you tested with? If possible, we recommend testing with the latest nightly build.\n\nI have tested with a source build\n\n### Did you include all relevant data sets for reproducing the issue?\n\nYes\n\n### Did you include all code required to reproduce the issue?\n\n- [X] Yes, I have\n\n### Did you include all relevant configuration (e.g., CPU architecture, Python version, Linux distribution) to reproduce the issue?\n\n- [X] Yes, I have\n",
  "hints_text": "The use of `VARBINARY` confused me a bit, `BLOB` is more commonly used for this type\r\nAlso `col::BIT` can be used in place of `CAST(col AS BIT)` to make this easier to read, especially with multiple casts taking place",

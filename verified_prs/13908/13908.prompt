<issue>
Inconsistent results when casting `BIT` and `VARBINARY`
### What happens?

Consider the following test case generated by my fuzzer. The second query and the third query could have inconsistent results. I suppose the second query should be consistently `true,true` and the third query should thus be `ab,cd`. 

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE  t1(c0 VARBINARY NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('ab'), ('cd');
-- INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('ðŸ¦†'); -- error
-- INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (NULL); -- error

SELECT t1.c0 FROM t1; -- 'ab', 'cd'
SELECT ((CAST(CAST(t1.c0 AS BIT) AS VARBINARY))<=(t1.c0)) FROM t1; -- true, true (incosistent, could sometimes be false, false)
SELECT t1.c0 FROM t1 WHERE ((CAST(CAST(t1.c0 AS BIT) AS VARBINARY))<=(t1.c0));
-- Expected: 'ab', 'cd' (2 rows)
-- Actual: could be 0 row, 1 row or 2 rows
```

Not sure if the two `INSERT` are needed. Sometimes I could also reproduce it without executing them, but sometimes can't.

Kindly inform me if it's an expected behavior and whether you could reproduce the issue.

  "problem_statement": "Range filters on empty/scarcely populated value ranges\nI encountered an issue with filter conditions on a ~30M row dataset. The problem arises when using a `WHERE x BETWEEN value1 AND value2` or `WHERE x > value1 AND x < value2` condition on value ranges which are not present (or only very scarcely) in the dataset. While scanning for values within this range, a Stack overflow error occurs - on my system at about 1GB of memory consumption by the process. Some preliminary debugging lead me to the Adaptive Filters, but I get a bit lost beyond that. \r\n\r\nThe following code should help to reproduce the issue. \r\n\r\nFirst generate some data:\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nnp.random.seed(1)\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.uniform(-10,10,size=(30000000, 4)), columns=list('xyzn'))\r\ndf.to_csv(\"test.csv\",index=False)\r\n\r\nimport duckdb\r\ncon = duckdb.connect(database='testdb', read_only=False)\r\ncon.execute(\"CREATE TABLE test AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('test.csv');\")\r\ncon.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, either execute in the python client:\r\n```\r\ncon = duckdb.connect(database='testdb', read_only=False)\r\ncon.execute(\"SELECT * FROM test WHERE x > -11.0 and x < -10.0 LIMIT 10;\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nOr in the duckdb cli:\r\n```\r\n.open testdb\r\n SELECT * FROM test WHERE x > -11.0 and x < -10.0 LIMIT 10;\r\n\r\n```\n",

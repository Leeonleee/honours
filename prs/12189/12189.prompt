Unexpected Result When Using `IS DISTINCT FROM` and `CASE WHEN` in a JOIN clause
### What happens?

The query involving the `IS DISTINCT FROM` operator with a `NATURAL RIGHT JOIN` returns an empty table when it should return one row. The expected behavior is that the `WHERE` condition would evaluate to `TRUE` (as the second query) and thus include the joined row in the result set.

### To Reproduce

```sql

CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT, c1 INT);
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t1 (c0, c1) VALUES (0, 1);

SELECT * FROM t0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t1; -- 0 1
SELECT ((CASE t0.c0 WHEN t0.c0 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END )IS DISTINCT FROM((1+(CASE t1.c1 WHEN t1.c1 THEN 2 ELSE NULL END )))) FROM t0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t1; -- true
SELECT * FROM t0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t1 WHERE ((CASE t0.c0 WHEN t0.c0 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END )IS DISTINCT FROM((1+(CASE t1.c1 WHEN t1.c1 THEN 2 ELSE NULL END ))));
-- Expected: 0 1
-- Actual: empty table
```

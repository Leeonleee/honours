Escaping string double quote in JSON Path Not Working
### What happens?

I’m encountering an issue with DuckDB when trying to extract a key from a JSON object using the json_extract function. The key contains special characters, specifically the string quote (") and the square bracket ([),
As per the DuckDB documentation, I am using double quotes in the JSON path (e.g., $.<key>) to escape the special characters. However, my key itself contains a double quote, which is causing the issue. The query fails with a JSON path error. I’ve tried escaping the double quote in the key with a backslash (\), but it doesn’t seem to work
Any help or guidance on how to correctly escape special characters in JSON paths, especially double quotes within the key, or a potential fix for this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

### To Reproduce

Here’s an example of the query that’s causing the problem:
```sql
select json_extract_string(json('{"j[so]n_\"key": 67}'), '$."j[so]n_\"key"');
```
or 
```sql
select json('{"j[so]n_\"key": 67}')->>'$."j[so]n_\"key"';
```
gives error
```
Binder Error: JSON path error near 'key"'
```

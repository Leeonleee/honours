Hive partitioned append/write 0.10.3 
### What happens?

Before version 0.10.3, you could enforce partitioned append to a Hive partitioned table by specifying the FILENAME_PATTERN 
property and setting OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE to true. 
However, since the recent changes (as documented in this GitHub pull request https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11787),
 the behavior has been modified. Now I am experiencing breaking changes in my applications.  Is there any alternative approach for partitioned append? The code below  illustrates the problem.

### To Reproduce

```sql
create or replace temp view t_val_v  as 
select *
from ( 
    values 
    ('p_1', 'key_1', 'val_1'),
    ('p_2', 'key_1', 'val_1'),
    ('p_3', 'key_1', 'val_1')
) as t_val(p_key, key, val);
copy (
    select *
    from  t_val_v
) to '/home/da/output_tmp/t_val' (
format parquet,
PARTITION_BY (p_key),
FILENAME_PATTERN "pv1_{i}",
OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE false
);
copy (
    select *
    from  t_val_v
) to '/home/da/output_tmp/t_val' (
format parquet,
PARTITION_BY (p_key),
FILENAME_PATTERN "pv2_{i}",
OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE false
);
```

output before. changes (version 0.10.2):

```bash
before 0.10.3 
~/output_tmp/t_val/p_key=p_1$ ls -la
total 16

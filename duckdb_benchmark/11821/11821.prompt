CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS doesn't work any more
### What happens?

`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` works as expected on `0.9.2`, but throws `Catalog Error` on `0.10.1`.

Note: this only occurs with `UNIQUE`, otherwise it's okay ü§î 

---

I'll concede that `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` [it isn't 'explicitly mentioned in the docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/create_index),
but it is covered by tests (albeit not the failing `UNIQUE` case) ‚¨áÔ∏è,
and since it worked as expected in 0.9.2 I'm hoping we can call this a Real Bug ü§ûüèª

### To Reproduce

Now:
```
v0.10.1 4a89d97db8
```
```sql
create table foo(bar int);
create unique index foo_bar_unique on foo(bar);
create unique index if not exists foo_bar_unique on foo(bar);
```
```
Catalog Error: An index with the name foo_bar_uniquealready exists!
```

But previously:
```
v0.9.2 3c695d7ba9
```
```sql
create table foo(bar int);
create unique index foo_bar_unique on foo(bar);
create unique index if not exists foo_bar_unique on foo(bar);
```

<issue>
Feature request: Please populate additional information_schema tables related to referential constraints
Please add Table constraint (Primary Key, Unique Key, NOT NULL) as well as Referential constraint (Foreign Key) metadata to the "information_schema" data dictionary.

I believe these tables would need to be populated (from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/information-schema.html):
"table_constraints": https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-table-constraints.html
"referential_constraints": https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-referential-constraints.html
"constraint_column_usage": https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-constraint-column-usage.html
"constraint_table_usage": https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-constraint-table-usage.html
"check_constraints": https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-check-constraints.html
... and possibly more...

Thank you!

  "problem_statement": "Named windows should respect scope\n### What happens?\r\n\r\nInitially raised in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/5607.\r\n\r\nNamed windows are accessible globally, not just in the CTE that they're used in, and as such window names must also be globally unique. I expected that they would be local to usage (CTE or subquery).\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis example shows the requirement for global uniqueness, failing because `my_window` was declared twice.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE a (id INT);\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n  cte_a AS (\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM a\r\n    WINDOW my_window AS ()\r\n  ),\r\n  cte_b AS (\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM a\r\n    WINDOW my_window AS ()\r\n  )\r\n\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM cte_a CROSS JOIN cte_b;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example shows global availability, using a named window from one CTE in another.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE a (id INT);\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n  cte_a AS (\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM a\r\n    WINDOW my_window AS ()\r\n  ),\r\n  cte_b AS (\r\n    SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER my_window AS n_rows,\r\n    FROM a\r\n  )\r\n\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM cte_a CROSS JOIN cte_b;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS:\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\n### DuckDB Version:\r\n\r\nv0.6.0 2213f9c946\r\n\r\n### DuckDB Client:\r\n\r\nDuckDB CLI\r\n\r\n### Full Name:\r\n\r\nLiam O'Boyle\r\n\r\n### Affiliation:\r\n\r\nNot using DuckDB in a work context (at the moment), but I am employed by https://github.com/raywhite.\r\n\r\n### Have you tried this on the latest `master` branch?\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree\r\n\r\n### Have you tried the steps to reproduce? Do they include all relevant data and configuration? Does the issue you report still appear there?\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree\n",
